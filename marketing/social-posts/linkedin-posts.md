## SHORT-FORM POSTS (Weekly)

### Post 1: Founder Story
I built CredentialMD because the credentialing system is broken — not for hospitals, but for the physicians inside it.

Enterprise platforms cost $10K+/year and serve credentialing departments. CME trackers cost $200/year and only track hours.

Nobody built the tool that physicians themselves actually need: a single app that tracks everything — licenses, CME with state-specific topic compliance, hospital privileges, malpractice insurance, case logs, health records — across all 50 states.

So we built it. $7.99/month. Free to start.

Because the person who spent 11 years training to save lives shouldn't have to spend another 15 hours a year on credential paperwork.

### Post 2: Data-Driven
Here's a number that should concern every physician:

The average credentialing delay is 90-120 days.

During that time, you can't practice at that facility. Can't bill. Can't see patients.

And the #1 cause of delays? Missing or expired documentation that the physician didn't know about.

CredentialMD sends alerts before anything expires. One app for every credential, every state.

This isn't a nice-to-have. It's career insurance for less than $2/week.

### Post 3: DO Community
Something that's bothered me for years:

Most CME tracking tools don't understand DO requirements.

They don't know that AOA Cat 1-A is different from AMA PRA Cat 1. They don't know that Arizona DOs need 24 hours of AOA Cat 1-A out of 40. They don't track the AOA national 150-hour requirement with 60 Cat 1-A minimum.

CredentialMD has full DO support built from the ground up. Every state. Every board requirement. AOA and ABMS.

If you're a DO who's been making do (no pun intended) with tools built only for MDs — this is for you.

### Post 4: Multi-State Practice
To every physician licensed in more than one state:

How confident are you that you're compliant in ALL of them?

Each state has different CME hour requirements, different topic mandates, different renewal cycles, different category minimums.

Texas wants ethics and opioid prescribing hours. California wants pain management. Florida wants HIV/AIDS, medical errors, AND domestic violence. New York wants infection control and implicit bias.

CredentialMD tracks topic-level compliance across every state you practice in. One dashboard. All green — or you know exactly what's missing.

### Post 5: Referral Program Launch
We just launched our referral program, and it's simple:

Give a month, get a month.

Share CredentialMD with a colleague. When they sign up for PRO, you both get a free month.

No complicated tiers. No points systems. Just physicians helping physicians.

Because the best marketing for a product that actually works is one doctor telling another: "You need this."

## LONG-FORM ARTICLE

### Title: "The Hidden Cost of Credential Chaos: Why Administrative Burden Is the Real Threat to Physician Careers"

**Subtitle:** A physician maintains 12+ active credentials. Most track them with spreadsheets and memory. Here's what that actually costs.

**Opening:**
Every year, physicians across America lose operating room privileges, experience billing interruptions, and face credentialing delays — not because they aren't qualified, but because a document expired and nobody noticed.

The problem isn't competence. It's infrastructure.

**The Scale of the Problem:**
The average physician maintains state medical licenses (often multiple), DEA registration, board certifications, hospital privileges at 1-3 facilities, malpractice insurance, CME credits with state-specific topic requirements, health screenings, and case logs. That's 12-20+ active credentials, each with different renewal dates, different requirements, and different submission processes.

The National Association Medical Staff Services (NAMSS) reports that the average initial credentialing application takes 90-120 days. Reappointment cycles add weeks of administrative overhead every 2 years.

**What Currently Exists (And Why It Falls Short):**
Enterprise credentialing platforms like HealthStream, Symplr, and Modio Health serve hospitals — not individual physicians. They cost $5,000-50,000+/year and are designed for credentialing departments to process applications, not for physicians to self-manage their careers.

CME tracking platforms like CE Broker and Mocingbird track continuing education hours, but most don't understand state-specific topic mandates. They can tell you that you have 40 hours. They can't tell you whether those 40 hours include the 2 hours of opioid prescribing that Texas requires or the 12 hours of pain management that California mandates.

There is no widely-adopted tool that gives individual physicians a unified view of ALL their credentials with state-specific compliance intelligence.

**The Solution We're Building:**
CredentialMD is a mobile-first credential management app built specifically for individual physicians. It tracks every credential type, knows the CME requirements for all 50 states (including topic-specific mandates and MD/DO distinctions), and lets physicians share their credentials with any institution in one tap.

The pricing reflects our values: $7.99/month for full access, with a free tier and a $3.99/month resident plan. We believe every physician should be able to afford credential management, not just hospitals with six-figure software budgets.

**CTA:**
If you're a physician managing credentials across multiple states or institutions, or if you've ever been surprised by an expiration you didn't see coming — try CredentialMD free at credentialmd.com.

And if you know a colleague who needs this: our referral program gives both of you a free month of PRO.
