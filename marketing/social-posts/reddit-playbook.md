## GOLDEN RULES FOR REDDIT

1. **Never post ads.** Reddit will destroy you.
2. **Be a physician first, a product second.** Answer questions helpfully. Only mention CredentialMD when it's genuinely relevant.
3. **Build karma first.** Spend 2-4 weeks commenting helpfully before ever mentioning the product.
4. **Use a personal account, not a brand account.** People trust people, not companies.
5. **If someone asks "what do you use?" — that's your moment.** Be honest and casual.

## COMMENT TEMPLATES (Use When Relevant)

### When someone asks about credentialing frustrations:
"I went through the same thing. Spent 3 weeks tracking down my CME transcript and realized I was short on opioid prescribing hours for Texas. Now I use an app called CredentialMD that tracks the state-specific topic requirements — it actually knew about the Texas requirement before I did. $8/mo. Saved me a lot of stress."

### When someone asks about CME tracking:
"Most CME trackers just count hours. The problem is each state has different TOPIC requirements (California wants pain management, Florida wants HIV/AIDS + medical errors, etc.). I found CredentialMD which tracks topic-level compliance for all 50 states. Has been more useful than anything else I've tried."

### When someone asks about multi-state licensing:
"Practicing in multiple states is a credentialing nightmare. Each state has different CME requirements, different renewal cycles, different topic mandates. I use CredentialMD to track all of them in one app — it knows the differences between MD and DO requirements too. Free tier available if you want to try it."

### When someone asks about locum tenens credentialing:
"Locums credentialing is its own special hell. I've been using CredentialMD to keep everything organized — licenses, CME, privileges, insurance, case logs — across all my states. The Quick Share feature is actually useful when a new facility asks for your credential packet."

### When a resident asks about getting organized:
"Start tracking everything now. Seriously. When you're an attending and credentialing asks for your documentation, you'll thank yourself. I use CredentialMD ($3.99/mo for residents) — it tracks licenses, CME, everything. But even if you don't use an app, at minimum keep a spreadsheet. Future you will appreciate it."

## POST IDEAS (Only post if you have established karma)

### r/medicine — Discussion Starter
**Title:** How do you track all your credentials? Looking for a better system than my 47-tab spreadsheet.

I'm licensed in 3 states and maintain privileges at 2 hospitals. Between state licenses, DEA, board certs, CME (with different topic requirements per state), malpractice insurance, and health records — I have at least 15 active credentials to track.

Currently using a spreadsheet that I update "when I remember" (narrator: he doesn't remember).

What's everyone else doing? Anyone found an actual system that works?

*[Let the discussion happen naturally. Respond to comments authentically. If someone asks what you've found, mention CredentialMD casually.]*

### r/Residency — Helpful Tip
**Title:** PGY-1 tip: Start tracking your credentials now. You'll thank yourself as an attending.

Your program tracks your hours. But nobody is tracking YOUR credentials for you — the licenses, CME, health records, etc. that you'll need when you start applying for attending positions and hospital privileges.

Start a system now. Even a spreadsheet works. But there are also apps designed for this (I use CredentialMD — it has a resident plan for $3.99/mo).

Trust me, your credentialing process will go so much smoother if you have 3-4 years of organized documentation ready to go.

## WHAT TO AVOID ON REDDIT

- Don't post links to your website in the post body
- Don't use marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", etc.)
- Don't post the same comment template in multiple threads
- Don't argue with critics — if someone says "sounds like an ad," just say "fair point, I'm genuinely just sharing what's worked for me"
- Don't create fake accounts or astroturf
- Don't ever post in r/medicine with a brand account
