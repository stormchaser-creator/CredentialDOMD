### WEEK 1: HUMOR + AWARENESS

**Post 1 — Pain Point**
POV: You're a surgeon who can remove a gallbladder in 45 minutes but can't find your DEA certificate in 45 days.

There's an app for that.

**Post 3 — Thread Starter**
THREAD: Your state's CME requirements are probably weirder than you think. 🧵

1/ California MDs need 12 hours of pain management CME. One-time. By your second renewal. Did you know?

2/ Florida requires 1 hour of HIV/AIDS, 2 hours of medical errors, AND 2 hours of domestic violence every third renewal.

3/ Texas? 48 hours over 2 years. 24 must be Cat 1. Plus 2 hours of ethics AND 2 hours of opioid prescribing.

4/ And if you're a DO in Arizona? 24 of your 40 hours must be AOA Cat 1-A. Max 16 AMA Cat 1.

5/ Most "CME trackers" don't know any of this. They count hours. CredentialMD tracks topic-level compliance for every state, MD and DO.

me: I'm very organized
also me: *has 3 expired credentials I found out about from my credentialing coordinator's passive-aggressive email*

CredentialMD sends you alerts before things expire. Revolutionary concept.

### WEEK 2: PROFESSIONAL + EDUCATIONAL

**Post 6 — Stat Drop**
The average physician maintains 12+ active credentials across multiple institutions.

The average tracking method? A spreadsheet. Or vibes.

CredentialMD puts it all in one place — licenses, CME, privileges, insurance, case logs, health records.

State-by-state compliance built in.

**Post 7 — Tip**

**Post 8 — Thought Leadership**
Unpopular opinion: The biggest threat to physician careers isn't burnout or malpractice.

It's administrative surprise.

A lapsed credential you didn't know about. A CME topic you missed. A privilege that expired while you were busy saving lives.

This is a solvable problem.

**Post 9 — DOs**
If you're a DO and your CME tracker doesn't know the difference between AOA Cat 1-A and AMA PRA Cat 1...

...it's not really tracking your compliance.

CredentialMD has full DO support. AOA national requirements, state-specific DO boards, all of it.

**Post 10 — Call to Action**
Locum docs: you carry credentials in how many states?

3? 5? 10?

CredentialMD tracks compliance across all of them. One app. Every state. Topic-level requirements.

Stop juggling spreadsheets.

### WEEK 3: EMOTIONAL + COMMUNITY

**Post 11 — Story**
A cardiologist told me she missed her daughter's recital because she was on hold with the state medical board verifying her license renewal.

She saves lives every day. But almost lost her privileges over a fax that didn't go through.

This is why CredentialMD exists.

**Post 12 — Referral Launch**
New: Give a month, get a month.

Share CredentialMD with a colleague. When they sign up for PRO, you both get a free month.

Because the best marketing is one physician telling another: "This actually works."

Reply with how many states you're licensed in. I'll guess how many spreadsheets you use to track them.

(CredentialMD tracks all 50 states. Just saying.)
