## FOR PHYSICIAN FACEBOOK GROUPS
*Post authentically. No hard sell. Be the helpful physician, not the salesperson.*

### Group Post 1: Ask for Pain Points (Engagement)
**Post in:** Physician community groups (Physician Side Gig, EM Physicians, Doctor Moms, etc.)

Hey everyone — quick question. How do you currently keep track of all your credentials? I'm talking licenses, DEA, CME, hospital privileges, malpractice insurance, the whole stack.

I've been using spreadsheets for years and I'm tired of the panic every time credentialing asks me for something. Wondering if anyone has found a better system.

*[Wait for comments, then respond naturally with CredentialMD as your personal solution — "I actually started using this app called CredentialMD and it's been a game-changer for me"]*

### Group Post 2: Value-Add (Educational)
**Post in:** Any physician group

PSA for anyone licensed in multiple states:

Every state has different CME topic requirements, not just different hour counts. For example, California MDs need 12 hours of pain management (one-time), Florida requires 1 hr HIV/AIDS + 2 hrs medical errors + 2 hrs domestic violence, and Texas requires 2 hrs ethics + 2 hrs opioid prescribing.

If you're a DO, it gets even more complex — many states have separate DO board requirements with AOA category distinctions.

I found a free checklist that breaks down the top 15 states' requirements: [link to lead magnet PDF]

Also, if anyone wants an app that tracks all of this automatically: credentialmd.com. I've been using it and it's $7.99/mo for everything.

### Group Post 3: Story (Emotional)
**Post in:** Physician community groups

True story: I almost lost my hospital privileges because my malpractice insurance lapsed and I didn't know. Nobody told me. I found out when I tried to schedule a case and was told I was "inactive."

Two weeks off the OR schedule. Two weeks of lost revenue. Two weeks of stress.

All because I didn't have a system that tracked everything in one place and sent me alerts.

I built a system now (using an app called CredentialMD), and I haven't had a surprise like that since. If anyone else has been through something similar — you're not alone, and there are solutions.

### Group Post 4: Referral Program Announcement
**Post in:** Any physician group where you're an active member

For anyone who's been hearing me talk about CredentialMD (sorry, I'm genuinely enthusiastic about it) — they just launched a referral program:

Share with a colleague → when they sign up for PRO → you both get a free month.

I've been using it to track my licenses, CME (it knows the topic-specific requirements for every state, MD and DO), hospital privileges, and malpractice insurance. $7.99/mo or free for the basic tier.

My referral link is [link]. No pressure, just sharing something that's made my life easier.

## FOR THE CREDENTIALMD FACEBOOK PAGE
*Branded posts for the official page.*

### Page Post 1: Launch Announcement
We're live.

CredentialMD is a mobile-first app that helps physicians track every credential in one place — licenses, CME, privileges, insurance, case logs, health records, and more.

We know the CME requirements for all 50 states, including topic-specific mandates for MDs and DOs. We send alerts before things expire. And we let you share credentials with any institution in one tap.

Free to start. $7.99/mo for PRO. $3.99/mo for residents.

Because you didn't go to med school to manage paperwork.

### Page Post 2: Feature Highlight
Did you know your DEA registration expires on your birthday month?

CredentialMD tracks this (and every other credential) and sends you alerts at 90, 60, and 30 days before expiration.

Never be surprised by a lapsed credential again.

Try it free: credentialmd.com

### Page Post 3: Testimonial
"I practice in 4 states. Before CredentialMD, I had a spreadsheet with 8 tabs and I still missed a CME deadline. Now everything is in one app, and it tells me exactly what topics each state requires. I don't think about credentialing anymore. It just... works."

### Page Post 4: Pricing Transparency
Let's talk pricing.

We could charge $200+/year like some competitors. But that's not who we are.

CredentialMD PRO: $7.99/month
CredentialMD Resident: $3.99/month
CredentialMD Free: $0, forever

We'd rather every physician in America could afford this than squeeze more money out of fewer people.

Your credentials are your career. Protecting them shouldn't cost a fortune.
