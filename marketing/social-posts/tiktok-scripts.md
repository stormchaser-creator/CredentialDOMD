## Ready to film. Pair with trending audio.

### TikTok 1: "It's giving..." (trending audio)
"It's giving... $240/year for an app that only tracks CME"
[disappointed face]

"It's giving... CredentialMD for $7.99/mo and it tracks EVERYTHING"
[chef's kiss]

### TikTok 2: "Things that just make sense"
[Text: "Things that just make sense for doctors"]

1. An app that tracks ALL your credentials, not just CME
2. State-by-state compliance that knows YOUR specific requirements
3. One tap to share credentials with any hospital
4. $7.99/mo instead of $200+/yr for less features
5. A resident plan for $3.99 because residents are already broke

Nobody:
Absolutely nobody:
My credentialing coordinator at 4:59 PM on a Friday:

"We need your updated license, DEA, board cert, malpractice COI, CME transcript, TB test, and flu shot documentation by Monday."

[Panic face → opens CredentialMD → taps Quick Share → sends all]

"Done. Have a good weekend, Karen."
