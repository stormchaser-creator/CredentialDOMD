## OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATE #1 — Cold Outreach to Physician Influencer

**Subject:** Quick question about your credentialing setup

Hi Dr. [Name],

I follow your content on [platform] and genuinely enjoy your perspective on [specific topic they post about].

I'm reaching out because we built something I think your audience would actually find useful — not another CME provider, but a credential management app.

CredentialMD tracks licenses, CME (with state-specific topic compliance for all 50 states), hospital privileges, malpractice insurance, case logs, and health records — all in one mobile-first app. It knows the difference between AOA Cat 1-A and AMA Cat 1. It sends alerts before things expire. And it lets you share credentials with any institution in one tap.

We're building an ambassador program and I'd love to offer you:

- Free lifetime PRO access
- 25% recurring revenue share on every physician you refer
- Zero scripts or obligations — just post when it genuinely makes sense

We're priced at $7.99/mo (residents: $3.99/mo), so this isn't a hard sell for your audience. It's legitimately affordable and useful.

Would you be open to trying the app and seeing if it's something worth sharing? No strings attached.

Best,
Eric
Founder, CredentialMD

## OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATE #2 — Warm Outreach (Mutual Connection)

**Subject:** [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out

Hi Dr. [Name],

[Mutual connection name] mentioned you might be interested in what we're building at CredentialMD.

Short version: we built a mobile app that tracks every physician credential in one place — licenses, CME with state-specific topic requirements, privileges, insurance, case logs, health records. All 50 states. MD and DO.

We're $7.99/mo (not $200+/yr like competitors) because we believe every physician should be able to afford this, not just hospitals with big budgets.

We're looking for 50 founding physician ambassadors. The deal:

- Free lifetime PRO
- 25% revenue share on referrals (recurring)
- No posting requirements — just share when it makes sense

Interested in trying it out?

Founder, CredentialMD

## OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATE #3 — Residency Program Director

**Subject:** Free credential tracking for your residents

Hi Dr. [Name],

I wanted to reach out about something that might be useful for your [specialty] residency program.

CredentialMD is a mobile app that helps physicians track all their credentials — licenses, CME, board certs, privileges, insurance, health records, case logs — in one place. It includes state-specific CME compliance tracking for all 50 states with topic-level requirements.

We'd like to offer free PRO accounts to all residents in your program.

Why? Residents are building their credential portfolio from scratch. If they start tracking early, they'll carry that habit (and our app) through their entire career. It's a long-term play for us, and genuine value for your residents.

There's no cost, no contract, no strings. We just think this would make your residents' lives a little easier.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call or email exchange to see if this is a fit?

Best,
Eric
Founder, CredentialMD

Awesome! Here's the deal — CredentialMD tracks licenses, CME (state-specific topic compliance, all 50 states), privileges, insurance, case logs, health records. Mobile-first. $7.99/mo for users, but yours is free permanently. If you end up liking it, we have an ambassador program: 25% recurring revenue share on anyone you refer. No obligations.
