# CredentialMD — Killer Features Roadmap
## What to build to crush the competition

## TIER 1: CRITICAL GAME-CHANGERS

### 1. Automated Monthly Compliance Monitoring
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** HIGH

NCQA changed rules in July 2025 to mandate monthly monitoring of every provider for licenses, board actions, exclusions, and SAM.gov screening. CredentialMD can auto-monitor 50+ data sources and alert physicians BEFORE lapse dates. This alone makes the app indispensable.

### 2. One-Click CAQH ProView Auto-Fill & Sync
**Effort:** Hard | **Impact:** HIGH

85% of credentialing applications have errors or missing info. Physicians spend hours filling CAQH only to manually re-enter the same data elsewhere. Build native CAQH integration that pushes data both directions. This eliminates the single biggest frustration in credentialing.

### 3. Real-Time Primary Source Verification Engine
**Effort:** Hard | **Impact:** HIGH

Primary source verification is the bottleneck — 30-60 days of the 90-120 day cycle. Build automated integrations with state boards, ABMS Direct Connect, DEA, OIG, and NPDB to verify instantly. Compress credentialing from 90 days to 30 days.

### 4. Locum Tenens Multi-Facility Credentialing Hub
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** HIGH

Locums rebuild credentialing from scratch for each assignment (60-90+ days per facility). Create a "credentials portfolio" that once verified, can be instantly shared to multiple facilities with pre-filled applications. IMLC now has 42 member states — automate compact licensure.

### 5. AI-Powered Document Ingestion with Intelligent Parsing
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** HIGH

Physicians spend hours manually entering data from certificates. Implement AI/OCR that automatically extracts data from any document type, cross-references against other sources, flags inconsistencies (like residency date mismatches), and pre-populates forms. Modio has this — CredentialMD must have it better.

## TIER 2: HIGH-VALUE DIFFERENTIATORS

### 6. Hospital Credentialing System Integrations (Epic, Cerner, Symplr, HealthStream)
**Effort:** Hard | **Impact:** HIGH

Hospitals use 4-5 different credentialing platforms. Offer direct APIs to top hospital systems so physician data flows into hospital credentialing workflows automatically. Become the hub.

### 7. Digital "Physician Passport" with Blockchain Verification
**Effort:** Hard | **Impact:** HIGH

Go beyond FSMB's FCVS: create a portable digital credential profile with immutable blockchain verification. Physicians share this "passport" to any new facility with one click. This is the future and almost nobody is doing it.

### 8. Peer Review & Credentialing Committee Collaboration
**Effort:** Easy | **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH

Peer reviews are rate-limiters; scheduling/collecting feedback takes weeks. Build an in-app module where committee members provide structured feedback and electronically sign off. Compress review cycles from 30 days to 7 days.

### 9. CME Marketplace with Topic-Specific Compliance Matching
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH

You already track CME for all 50 states. Become a distribution channel: build a marketplace where physicians can earn CME directly within CredentialMD. Partner with ACCME-accredited providers. Auto-log compliance hours. Revenue center.

### 10. Expedited Credentialing Fast-Track (30-Day SLA)
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH

Tie features 2, 3, 5, and 8 together into "CredentialMD FastTrack": physician uploads everything, AI ingests, PSV happens instantly, committee reviews digitally, done in 30 days. Charge $500-1,500 per credentialing. Hospitals will white-label this.

## TIER 3: IMPORTANT ENHANCEMENTS

### 11. Automated Insurance Verification + Malpractice Claims Tracking
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** MEDIUM

Integrate with malpractice carriers and NPDB to auto-flag claim activity and update credentialing records. Track exclusion lists (OIG, SAM, OFAC) monthly.

### 12. Case Log Auto-Population from EHR/EMR
**Effort:** Hard | **Impact:** MEDIUM

Integrate with Epic, Cerner to auto-pull case data. Physicians click "sync" and case details populate without manual logging.

### 13. Specialty-Specific Credentialing Templates
**Effort:** Easy | **Impact:** MEDIUM

Pre-built templates for 40+ medical specialties with specialty-specific forms, CME tracks, and case log requirements.

### 14. Compliance Report Cards for Hospitals/Insurance Companies
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** MEDIUM

Let hospitals request a "compliance report" showing completeness scores, missing docs, and red flags before submission. Hospitals will demand this.

### 15. Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) Auto-Coordination
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** MEDIUM

42 states in IMLC now. Auto-recognize when a physician qualifies and streamline compact licensure filing.

### 16. Telehealth-Specific Credentialing Path
**Effort:** Easy | **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM

CMS updated telehealth credentialing rules in 2025. Create a simplified credentialing track for physicians working across state lines via telehealth only.

## THE "CAN'T PRACTICE WITHOUT IT" FACTOR

With monthly compliance monitoring now mandatory (NCQA, effective July 2025), a physician without automated alerts is in violation-risk territory. CredentialMD becomes the compliance backbone that hospitals and insurance companies eventually demand their network providers use. That's when you go from "nice app" to "industry standard."
