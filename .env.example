# Anthropic API Key (required for AI document scanning feature)
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
# NOTE: In the current client-side architecture, this key is stored in the browser.
# For production deployment, route API calls through a backend proxy instead.
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# NPI Proxy URL (optional, for production web deployment)
# The NPPES API doesn't support CORS, so a proxy is needed for browser access.
# In development, the Vite dev server proxies requests automatically.
# For production, deploy a serverless proxy (Cloudflare Worker, Vercel Edge Function)
# and set the URL here.
