# CredentialDOMD — Session Orientation

The user-facing product/company name is CredentialDOMD, with this exact capitalization. Use it in website/app labels, emails, documents, generated content, and assistant responses. Preserve existing lowercase email addresses/domains, identifiers, storage keys, and the legal registered entity name.

**Status:** App built. Marketing materials exist (playbook PPTX, design research). SEO implemented (robots.txt, sitemap, Schema.org). "Add to Home Screen" FAQ done. Signup forms with honeypot anti-spam.
